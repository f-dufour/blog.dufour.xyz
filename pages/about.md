This blog is written by me, Florent Dufour. I am a Ph.D. student in AI in medicine at the Technical University Munich. I work on privacy preserving AI with an emphasis on cryptographic enclaves.

I'm a biologist at heart, previously working on new technology applied to healthcare in the fields of nanotechnology, artificial organ design, and high throughput data processing.

I am an avid coder and tech hacker.
