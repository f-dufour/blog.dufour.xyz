I wanted to self-host a URL shortener for a long time in order to easily share blog posts, lecture material, files etc. Surprisingly,<!--more--> none of the solutions listed on [Awesome-Selfhosted](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted#url-shorteners) were really fitting me. They usually require a frontend, a database, and sometimes don't run in ARM docker containers without a bit of hacking. Besides, I'm not interested in fancy features like analytics, access control, and co.

KISS[^KISS]! I just need a set of HTML pages with a `http-equiv="refresh"` tag that points to my target!

I take a shower and realize I can repurpose [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) very much like I did to generate [podcast RSS feeds](https://podcast.dufour.xyz), but this with HTTP redirects pages. A couple of commits later, the first prototype is working. I feel refreshed, smell like a coconut, and the project is available on Github: [du4.link](https://github.com/f-dufour/du4.link).
