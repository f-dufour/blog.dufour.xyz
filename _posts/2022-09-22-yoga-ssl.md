Even though getting enlightened while doing the dishes sounds enticing, many people are nowadays equipped with a dishwasher. Luckily enough, technical innovation does not permeate<!--more--> all aspects of one's life at the same pace, leaving leeway for inner work[^LSR]. If you're into IT and can relate, this blog post is for you. You don't need to know anything about CI/CD, kubernetes, or certbots.

Karma Yoga is the transformation of being that is based on one's daily work in the world[^bhn]. So now let's have a surprise, let's see how daunting we can make a simple task in order to get the witness, awareness, (and patience) in action[^kyia]. We'll use SSL certificates as an alibi and see  how big of an endeavour we can make configuring [Tr√¶fik](https://traefik.io) with custom certificates[^TraefikTLSDoc] [^Colding]. We'll expose 1 web app to a WAN via https.

I've been deploying containerized applications for many years now. Steps remained the same, growing on me like a mantra:

<!-- You got it ;) Clone the repository, adapt the docker-compose.yaml, build image and run the container, configure the storage/database, make a DNS record point to the container, securely expose the endpoint to a WAN, perhaps behind a VPN. -->

This process takes me between 15 minutes and 0.5 days depending on the quality of the documentation and my level of caffeination. We are however not looking for speed or efficiency here, I'm just bragging.

Let's start the exercise. Let's first request the resources we will need to run our 2 containers. Durations are for indicative purposes only.

|#|Task|Duration|
|:-:|-|-|
|1|Get compute (e.g., a Debian VM) with an IP on a WAN|1 day|
|2|Install Docker, build and run 2 containers|10 minutes|
|3|Get the domain name|4 months|
|4|Get the email configuration|6 weeks|
|5|Get SSL certificate|1 week|
|6|Get SSL certificate again, this time without a typo|20 days|
|6|Piece everything together|10 minutes|
|||<u>Total: ~190 days</u>|

The net result is promising, very yogic. After involving only 6 people and in less than 200 days one gets: 1 mostly idling VM (for 2 containers), no service redundancy, no backup strategy, no CI/CD, but another prospective round of emails in 1 year when certs will silently expire (you may want to put a reminder in your calendar now before you forget).

---

All the pieces are now here. Let's add a third container in the mix. Tr√¶fik is our reverse proxy of choice. Below, `docker-compose.yaml` is given to serve the web app (myapp in the example) using a PostgreSQL database (db in the example). You'll need to mount the certificate and key file you got via email into the Tr√¶fik container and reference them in `traefik_dynamic.yaml`, itself referenced in `traefik.yaml`. All code snippets are provided below.

After issuing `~$ docker compose up`, you should be able to read Tr√¶fik's logs. It should look like `traefik.json` provided below.

Here are some things you may want to check if stuff goes wrong:

1. Are you using the right certificate and key file?
  - Use the `file` CLI tool to check the types of your files on the file system. You should see `server.pem: PEM certificate`, `private.key: ASCII text`
  - You can `cat` the content of the files:
    - `server.pem` is contained between `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` and `-----END CERTIFICATE-----`
    - `private.key` is contained between `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----` and `-----END PRIVATE KEY-----`
2. Have a look into Tr√¶fik's logs: `/var/log/traefik.json`, not just the stdout provided to Docker.
3. Map port 8080 in `docker-compose.yaml` and allow api insecure and dashboard in `traefik.yaml` to peak into the services status.
