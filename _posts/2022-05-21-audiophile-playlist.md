Being an audiophile is as much about the gear as it is about the music. I had an offbeat feeling this year, as if air was shaking while missing out on the art component. Luckily<!--more-->, sticking long enough with the [Admire Audio AA4](https://admireaudio.com/aa4/) led me to re-discover _"Volver volver", Buika (2008)_. There's definitely something magical about horns, especially when they're lifting voices like Buika's (wait for the trumpet to enter). Other time, other horns, the [Avantgarde Trio G3](https://avantgarde-acoustic.de/trio/) is playing _"Two Thousand and Seventeen", Four Tet (2017)_. I like how they got people silent, meditative, with unabashed basses, and ultra-wide and sharp soundscapes.

The rest of the show unfortunately remained musically underwhelming. Why does everyone seem to be playing Norah Jones and Katie Melua[^1]?

Finally, some kicks permeate a closed door. The _Adriatique Remix of "Atlas", Marc Romboy (2015)_ is playing on the impressive [Credo Cinema LTM](https://www.credo-audio.ch/cinema-ltm-eng.html). Did we really have to wait for the Swiss to come and play German house — loud — in Germany?

Anyway, here are two hours of unordered tracks I think make sense for my taste when listening to a new system:
