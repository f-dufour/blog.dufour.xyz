Pint of Science 2020 was expected to take place on the three evenings of the 11<sup>th</sup>, 12<sup>th</sup>, and 13<sup>th</sup> of May 2020 worldwide. 

However, as you may have learned from elsewhere, the global  COVID-19 situation and the extended containment period made us reconsider these dates. <!--more--> The situation has taken such an important and dramatic dimension that we decided it is safer for the event not to take place this early.

We want Pint of Science to happen in the best conditions, as it has always had. Even though it requires a lot of rethink for the organizing teams and speakers, <em>the event will still take place in 2020, but on the evenings of the 7<sup>th</sup>, 8<sup>th</sup>, and 9<sup>th</sup> of September 2020!</em> Tickets sales are expected to start in early July! Yaaay!

We hope that everyone will recover until then and that we will be able to meet in bars to share science. However, if it happens not to be possible still, no worries ! We anticipate live streaming the talks on the internet. Therefore, we encourage you to safely keep a beer in your refrigerator!

Do not hesitate to support the organization by [donating](https://pintofscience.com/donate/).

Keep safe !
