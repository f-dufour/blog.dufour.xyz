If you share the same feeling as mine, 2020 will be awesome in many ways.

I officially launch this blog today and I expect it to crystalize what *really* matters. It may not seem like much, but I wanted to find a medium that better fits my requirements socially-wise.

Perhaps I will explain in later posts how I grew to <s>despise</s> <!--more-->leave Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, and other social media, but [Souvenirs of an Electric Co.](https://blog.dufour.xyz) intends to be a safer place for me to write and express myself. It is not directing towards a single cape, but will instead be cruising between various aspects of my daily life as an academic, health scientist, blockchain developer, and sensitive human being. I expect to share ideas, projects, developer tips, recipes, travels, as well as both light and heavy life momentums.

I hope readers will find this content nourishing while providing them with the desire to discover and reveal the best of themselves.

Keep your lamps trimmed and burning.
